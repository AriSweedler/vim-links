# My links
This links plugin lets me use CTRL-K to make links. Press it in insert mode to
set the k-mark, press it again to make a link.

# Installation
Install this using vim's built-in package support:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    git clone git@github.com:AriSweedler/vim-links.git links

Haha that's literally it. Vim is pretty cool and so are you if you're
installing my plugin.
